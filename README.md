# ml-traditional-sklearn

Classical Machine Learning projects implemented with scikit-learn, focused on regression and classification tasks, including Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, KNN, and RNN. The repository contains:


[Real Estate Price Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y9r1Q6QtUyJbUjdHX3c5v3vjHNCGuKLF)
 – regression project using Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net for predicting housing prices. Features include data preprocessing, handling outliers and skewed distributions, data visualization, performance metrics analysis, and reporting.


[Exotic Fruit Classification](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1geewjM-3MdSp8msHkjA6xj2VIbfS134p)
 – classification project using KNN and RNN for identifying exotic fruits. Includes data preprocessing, outlier detection and treatment, visualization, analysis of accuracy and other metrics, and reporting.

All projects emphasize: data preprocessing and cleaning, identification and treatment of outliers and skewed values, visualization of results, performance evaluation across multiple benchmarks, and detailed reporting with analysis of key metrics and insights.

Technologies used: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, executed in Google Colab.
